![Alt text](http://coding.javdev.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/intersection_shader.gif "Intersection Highlight Shader")

Using the [Multiple Render Target implementation done by Flare3D](https://github.com/Flare3D/labs/tree/master/src/agal2) I've extended it to be used in an Intersection Highlight Shader.

#Prerequisites
1. You should have [FlashDevelop]( http://www.flashdevelop.org/) installed
2. You should have the [Flare3D IDE installed](http://flare3d.com/downloads/) if you want to edit the shaders
3. I've included the SWF so that you can run the demo
